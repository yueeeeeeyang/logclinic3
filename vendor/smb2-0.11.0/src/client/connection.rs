//! Connection state and message exchange with actor-based routing.
//!
//! The [`Connection`] type manages a single TCP connection to an SMB server.
//! A background receiver task owns the transport's read half, demultiplexes
//! incoming frames by `MessageId`, and routes each response to the matching
//! per-request `oneshot::Sender`. The caller-thread path holds the write
//! half (guarded by its own Mutex via the transport trait) and pushes a
//! per-request `oneshot::Receiver` onto a FIFO that `receive_response`
//! pops from.
//!
//! See `docs/specs/connection-actor.md` for the full design (Phase 2).

    // They target the cancellation-by-drop failure mode that Phase 1's
    // `HashSet<MessageId>` demux cannot solve: when a caller's future is
    // dropped mid-flight (for example, by `tokio::task::JoinHandle::abort()`),
    // the in-flight MessageIds stay in `pending`; server responses for those
    // ids then get handed to the next caller as if they were legitimate.
    //
    // Post-Phase-2, each in-flight request carries its own `oneshot::Sender`;
    // when the caller's `Receiver` is dropped (future aborted), the receiver
    // task discards the response silently on arrival.
