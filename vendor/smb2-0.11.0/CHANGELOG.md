# Changelog

All notable changes to smb2 will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and we use
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **In-process diagnostics.** `SmbClient::diagnostics()` and `Connection::diagnostics()` return a `Diagnostics` / `ConnectionDiagnostics` snapshot of the client's current state — negotiated dialect, credits + in-flight count + next `MessageId`, signing/encryption/compression status, RTT estimate, DFS cache, the per-connection session, and a `MetricsSnapshot` of 17 monotonic `AtomicU64` counters (requests sent, wire bytes sent/received, the four disjoint routing outcomes — `responses_routed_ok`, `responses_routed_err`, `responses_late_after_drop`, `responses_stray` — plus `status_pending_loops`, `unsolicited_notifications_received`, `signature_failures`, `decrypt_failures`, `decompress_failures`, `malformed_frames`, `session_expired_events`, `compound_requests_sent`, `explicit_cancels_sent`, `requests_returned_err`). Counters survive connection teardown; per-connection counters reset on `SmbClient::reconnect`, client-level counters (`reconnects`, `dfs_referrals_resolved`, `dfs_cache_hits`) survive. A `Display` impl renders a compact terminal view. See [`docs/specs/diagnostics-plan.md`](docs/specs/diagnostics-plan.md).
- **Optional `serde` feature** (off by default): `Serialize` impls on every diagnostics type plus the protocol enums they embed (`Dialect`, `Cipher`, `SigningAlgorithm`, `Capabilities`, `Guid`, `SessionId`, `TreeId`, `MessageId`). For consumers building MCP tools, dashboards, or any structured exporter. JSON form is the in-memory shape (newtypes are `transparent`, `Capabilities` is the raw `u32` bits).
- **`examples/diagnostics.rs`**: connect, run a couple of ops, dump the snapshot via `Display` — or `--json` when built with `--features serde`.

### Fixed

- **Stale `src/client/CLAUDE.md` gotcha** about silent frame discard on decrypt/decompress/malformed-header errors. Phase 3 P3.4 fixed this — the receiver task tears down the connection on those paths and fans `Err(Disconnected)` to every pending waiter. Note now matches the code, and the diagnostics counters above attribute each tear-down to its trigger.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-19

### Changed

- **Breaking: `Watcher` owns its `Connection` and `Tree` instead of borrowing them.** The lifetime parameter is gone; `Watcher` is now `'static`. `Tree::watch` and `SmbClient::watch` lose their `'a` parameter and return `Watcher` instead of `Watcher<'a>`. Existing call sites that wrote `let mut w = client.watch(&tree, "path", true).await?;` keep compiling unchanged — only code that explicitly named the type as `Watcher<'_>` needs the `<'_>` removed. The connection clone is cheap (`Arc::clone`, multiplexes over the same SMB session), so the caller is free to keep using their `Connection` for other ops while a watcher runs. The previous "use a separate `SmbClient` to perform operations while watching" workaround is no longer needed.

### Fixed

- **CHANGE_NOTIFY consumer-side loss window closed.** `Watcher::next_events` now keeps one CHANGE_NOTIFY request continuously outstanding on the wire by pre-issuing the next request before awaiting the current response. Without this, server-side events that arrived during the consumer's response-processing window were dropped silently by strict servers (older Samba builds, NAS firmware) that don't queue events between consecutive CHANGE_NOTIFY requests. Reproduced in the field as 9 file copies → 4 watcher events delivered. Confirmed against Docker Samba, QNAP TS-464, and Windows-shape servers via `tests/integration.rs::nas_accepts_stacked_change_notify` and the new unit test in `src/client/watcher.rs::loss_window_tests`.

### Added

- `Connection::dispatch` / `Connection::dispatch_with_credits` (crate-internal): variant of `execute` that returns once `transport.send().await` completes, handing back the response `oneshot::Receiver` for the caller to await separately. Enables pipelining patterns where the next request must be on the wire before the previous one's response is processed.

### Notes

- **Server compatibility check**: the fix relies on the server accepting two simultaneous CHANGE_NOTIFY requests on the same `FileId`. MS-SMB2 allows it; Windows, modern Samba (Docker fixtures), and QNAP TS-464 firmware all confirmed-good. Servers that reject would surface `Err(Error::Protocol { status: ..., command: ChangeNotify })` on the second `next_events()` call. If you hit this on a particular NAS, please file an issue with the NTSTATUS — a config-flag fallback to depth-0 (pre-issue off) is straightforward to add but hasn't been needed yet.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- New consumer-class fixture `smb-consumer-maxreadsize` (port 10494, env `SMB_CONSUMER_MAXREADSIZE_PORT`)
  with `smb2 max read = smb2 max write = 65536`. Mirrors the internal-fixture
  `smb-maxreadsize` so consumer apps can guard against streaming-fallback regressions
  (every transfer >64 KB is chunked, exercising the same code path that hung pre-0.9.0)
  without standing up smb2's `internal/` fixtures. Exposed via `smb2::testing::maxreadsize_port()`
  and shipped through `write_compose_files`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- **Breaking: `FileWriter` owns its `Connection` and `Arc<Tree>` instead of borrowing `&'a mut Connection`.** The
  lifetime parameter is gone; `FileWriter` is now `'static`. Multiple writers built from clones of the same
  `Connection` pipeline their WRITEs over one SMB session, multiplexed by `MessageId` in the receiver task — no
  external locking needed.
- **Breaking: `Tree::create_file_writer` signature changed** from `(&self, conn: &mut Connection, path)` to
  `(self: &Arc<Self>, conn: Connection, path)`. Callers that previously held an owned `Tree` need
  `Arc::new(tree)` once; callers using `SmbClient::create_file_writer` are unaffected at the call site (the
  client wraps the cloning internally).
- **Breaking: `SmbClient::create_file_writer` takes `&self` instead of `&mut self`** and returns
  `FileWriter` (no lifetime) instead of `FileWriter<'_>`. The previous `&mut self` requirement was the root cause
  of a deadlock in the cmdr SMB volume's `write_from_stream` under sustained concurrent pressure on QNAP — the
  consumer had to hold its session mutex for the entire streaming upload.
- **Breaking: `Tree` is now `#[derive(Clone)]`.** Lets convenience constructors wrap a `Tree` in `Arc` without
  reconstructing field-by-field. Cloning a `Tree` is cheap (one `TreeId`, three short `String`s, two bools).

### Added

- `client::stream::open_file_writer(tree: Arc<Tree>, conn: Connection, path: &str) -> Result<FileWriter>` — free
  function for building a `FileWriter` when you already hold a cloned `Connection` and an `Arc<Tree>` and don't
  want the convenience-wrapper indirection. `Tree::create_file_writer` and `SmbClient::create_file_writer` both
  delegate to it.

### Notes

- Internal callers in `Tree::write_file_pipelined` and `Tree::write_file_streamed` were not touched: they use
  their own per-chunk `execute_with_credits` loop and never built a `FileWriter`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- **Breaking: `ErrorKind` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`.** Match expressions over `ErrorKind` must include a `_` arm.
  Adding a new variant in a future release is now a non-breaking change. Consumers that already use a `_` fallback
  (the pattern recommended by the doc example) need no update.

### Added

- `ErrorKind::AlreadyExists` — `STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_COLLISION` (returned by `Create` when a file or directory of the
  same name exists) now classifies as `AlreadyExists` instead of falling through to `Other`. Lets callers handle
  "merge into existing directory" or surface a friendly "name taken" message without substring-matching the error
  text.
- `ErrorKind::IsADirectory` — `STATUS_FILE_IS_A_DIRECTORY` now classifies as `IsADirectory`. Useful for
  delete-fast-path callers that try `delete_file` first and fall back to `delete_directory` on this kind.
- `ErrorKind::NotADirectory` — `STATUS_NOT_A_DIRECTORY` now classifies as `NotADirectory` (e.g., `list_directory` on
  a file).
- `error::tests::classify_status_contract`: a single table-driven test that documents the full `NtStatus → ErrorKind`
  mapping, including statuses intentionally left as `Other`. Replaces the per-arm classification tests so the contract
  lives in one auditable place; adding a new `NtStatus` should also add a row here.

### Notes

- `STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_INVALID`, `STATUS_DELETE_PENDING`, `STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`, and
  `STATUS_INSUFF_SERVER_RESOURCES` deliberately still classify as `ErrorKind::Other` — no current consumer needs to
  branch on them. Promoting any of these to its own variant is non-breaking under the `#[non_exhaustive]` policy.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- DFS referral response parser (`msg::dfs::RespGetDfsReferral::unpack`): a V2 entry whose server-declared `entry_size`
  was small enough to pass the initial `entry_size < 4` guard but short enough to truncate the fixed body would
  trigger a panic (out-of-bounds) on the final `network_address_offset` read. The V2 body is 18 bytes after the
  4-byte version/size prefix, not 16. Found by fuzzing; regression covered by
  `msg::dfs::tests::resp_parse_v2_short_entry_returns_clean_error`.

### Added

- `fuzz/` crate using `cargo-fuzz` with 12 fuzz targets across the parse entry points: top-level SMB2 header,
  TRANSFORM/COMPRESSION transform headers, compound-frame splitter, full frame + sub-frame body parse, Negotiate
  request/response (negotiate contexts), Create request/response (create contexts), QueryInfo response, and DFS
  referral response. Seed corpus generator at `tests/fuzz_seeds.rs` (run with
  `cargo test --test fuzz_seeds -- --ignored`). Targets are feature-gated behind `fuzzing`; the feature exposes
  parse entry points via `smb2::fuzzing` and is not meant for application use.
- `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`: weekly 5-minute-per-target fuzz run on schedule + manual dispatch.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- `Tree::download` for streaming reads driven by a borrowed `Connection`, mirroring the existing `SmbClient::download`
  but unlocking concurrent downloads on a single SMB session (via `Connection::clone`).

### Changed

- `Tree::open_file` and `FileDownload::new` are now `pub` (were `pub(crate)`), so callers can build custom chunk loops
  or reuse a handle across multiple readers.
- `SmbClient::download` now delegates to `Tree::download` — zero behavior change.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-21

First public release on crates.io. Bundles the FileWriter streaming write API with the Phase 3 Connection actor
refactor (breaking API change).

### Changed

- **Breaking: `Connection`'s send/receive API collapsed into `execute` / `execute_compound`** (Phase 3 of the
  actor refactor). The legacy `send_request`, `send_request_with_credits`, `send_compound`,
  `receive_response`, `receive_compound`, and `receive_compound_expected` are gone; callers use a single
  awaitable call per op. `Connection::execute(command, body, tree_id)` returns `Result<Frame>` where
  `Frame = { header, body, raw }`. `Connection::execute_compound(&[CompoundOp])` returns
  `Result<Vec<Result<Frame>>>` — the outer `Result` is "did the compound hit the wire", the inner one is
  per-sub-op so partial-failure handling (for example, `CREATE` ok, `READ` fails, issue standalone `CLOSE`
  with the returned `FileId`) is straightforward. `Connection: Clone`; clones share the receiver task so
  concurrent `execute` calls from different tasks/clones multiplex over the same SMB session. Cancelling
  (dropping) a future mid-flight is safe by construction — the matching late-arriving frame is discarded.
- `Connection` now uses a background receiver task with per-request `oneshot::Sender` routing (Phase 2 of
  the actor refactor). See `docs/specs/connection-actor.md`. A caller's dropped future (for example,
  `tokio::task::JoinHandle::abort()` in a downstream consumer) now correctly discards the corresponding
  late-arriving response instead of letting it pollute the next operation's receive. Credits still tick on
  dropped-caller frames so throughput stays correct under cancellation churn.
- `tokio` is formalized as a hard runtime requirement; added `"rt"` to the tokio feature set. The library
  spawns a receiver task per `Connection`.
- `MockTransport::receive()` now awaits via `tokio::sync::Notify` when the queue is empty instead of
  returning `Err(Disconnected)` immediately. Added `MockTransport::close()` to signal end-of-stream. This
  lets the background receiver task stay alive across a test's interleaved `queue_response` calls. External
  consumers writing tests with `MockTransport` directly need to call `close()` to get the old behavior.
- `MockTransport::enable_auto_rewrite_msg_id()` — opt-in test-mode shim that rewrites each zero-msg_id
  sub-frame of a queued response to match the next pending sent msg_id in FIFO order, so canned
  `build_*_response` helpers that hardcode `MessageId(0)` route through the Phase 3 receiver task without
  needing to predict the caller's allocated msg_ids. Replaces the pre-Phase-3
  `Connection::set_orphan_filter_enabled(false)` escape hatch.

### Migration guide (pre-Phase-3 → Phase 3)

Single request:
```rust
// Before
conn.send_request(Command::Create, &req, Some(tree_id)).await?;
let (header, body, _raw) = conn.receive_response().await?;
// After
let frame = conn.execute(Command::Create, &req, Some(tree_id)).await?;
// frame.header, frame.body, frame.raw
```

Compound request:
```rust
// Before
let ops = vec![(Command::Create, &create_req, CreditCharge(1)), /*...*/];
conn.send_compound(tree_id, &ops).await?;
let responses = conn.receive_compound_expected(3).await?;
// responses: Vec<(Header, Vec<u8>)>
// After
let ops = [
    CompoundOp { command: Command::Create, body: &create_req, tree_id: Some(tree_id), credit_charge: CreditCharge(1) },
    // ...
];
let frames = conn.execute_compound(&ops).await?;
// frames: Vec<Result<Frame>> — each entry may independently be Err (session expired, signature
// verify failure, etc.). Sub-op status codes (OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND and friends) ride in
// frames[i].as_ref()?.header.status, NOT in the inner Result.
```

Pipelined sliding-window reads/writes: use `futures_util::stream::FuturesUnordered` of boxed
`execute_with_credits` futures across `conn.clone()`s — see `src/client/tree.rs::read_pipelined_loop` for
the canonical pattern. `MAX_PIPELINE_WINDOW` and `conn.credits()`-based pacing stay on the caller side.

### Added

- `FileWriter` — push-based streaming write API with pipelined I/O. Consumer drives the loop, pushing chunks via
  `write_chunk()` with automatic backpressure (sliding window, credit-aware). Complement to `FileDownload` for reads.
  Created via `SmbClient::create_file_writer()`.
- `FileWriter::abort()` — fast-cancel companion to `finish()`. Discards any unsent data, drains in-flight
  WRITE responses to keep credits and message IDs in sync, skips the server-side FLUSH (fsync), and does a
  best-effort CLOSE. Errors during drain/close are swallowed so callers can exit quickly. Use on
  cancellation or error paths where the partial remote file is going to be deleted anyway — it saves the
  fsync round-trip vs. calling `finish()`. The caller is responsible for deleting the partial file.
- `Connection::receive_compound_expected(n)` — gathers exactly `n` compound sub-responses, transparently
  reading additional transport frames when the server splits the chain. All compound-using methods
  (`read_file_compound`, `write_file_compound`, `fs_info`, `stat`, `rename`, `delete_file`/`delete_directory`,
  and the batch `delete_files`/`rename_files`/`stat_files`) now use it.
- 13 new Docker integration tests for `FileWriter`: basic, large (5 MB), empty, single byte, overwrite,
  equivalence with `write_file_pipelined`, binary data integrity, 64 KB max-write-size, signing, encryption,
  read-only rejection, 100 MB stress (guest), 100 MB stress (200ms latency)
- 10 new unit tests for `FileWriter` pipelining, backpressure, chunk splitting, error handling

### Fixed

- Unrecoverable frame errors (decrypt auth-tag mismatch, decompression failure, malformed sub-frame
  header after compound splitting) no longer hang pending waiters indefinitely. Previously the
  receiver task log-at-WARN'd and `continue`d, which left any waiter matching the discarded frame's
  `MessageId` stuck on `rx.await` forever — the `msg_id` isn't recoverable from an unparseable frame,
  so no targeted error could be delivered. Per decision E6 in the Phase 3 design, the receiver task
  now tears the connection down on these conditions: fans `Err(Disconnected)` to every pending
  waiter and exits. Callers see the error promptly and can reconnect. Sub-frame signature-verification
  failures and `STATUS_NETWORK_SESSION_EXPIRED` stay targeted (delivered only to the matching waiter)
  because the `msg_id` is known.
- Caller futures that get dropped mid-flight (for example, a cancelled listing task in a consuming
  application) no longer leave in-flight SMB requests on the wire that corrupt subsequent operations.
  The receiver task discards late-arriving frames whose waiter's `oneshot::Receiver` has been dropped.
  Reproduces and fixes the cmdr `listing_task.abort()` regression.
- Compound requests no longer error with `invalid_data: expected N compound responses, got M` when the
  server sends responses as separate frames instead of one compounded frame. Per MS-SMB2 3.3.4.1.3 the
  server SHOULD compound but MAY split, and Samba (including QNAP NAS firmware built on Samba) splits
  in some scenarios. Hit in the wild via `fs_info` against a QNAP NAS.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- `write_file_streamed` — write files from a streaming callback source with pipelined I/O, bounded memory usage
  (sliding window, not full file), automatic chunk splitting at `MaxWriteSize`, works with signing and encryption
  ([f5ade78](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/f5ade78))
- 14 new tests: 3 unit (basic, empty, callback error), 9 Docker integration (guest, small, large 10 MB, empty, early
  stop, 64 KB max-write-size, mandatory signing, mandatory encryption, read-only rejection), 2 NAS integration
  (write + verify, performance comparison vs `write_file_pipelined`)

### Fixed

- Bumped `rand` 0.9.2 → 0.9.4 (RUSTSEC-2026-0097)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

  ([edcf730](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/edcf730))

### Fixed

- IOCTL `InputOffset` double-counted `Header::SIZE`, causing `STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER` on DFS referral requests
  ([edcf730](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/edcf730))
- DFS paths missing `server\share` prefix in `Tree::format_path`
  ([edcf730](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/edcf730))
- Cross-server routing matched hostname-only instead of addr:port
  ([edcf730](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/edcf730))

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- Kerberos authentication — full AS + TGS + AP-REQ flow with pre-auth, tested end-to-end against Windows Server 2022
  with Active Directory Domain Services

  ASN.1 dependency ([c27c88f](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/c27c88f))
- Kerberos crypto: AES-CTS (RFC 3962), RC4-HMAC (RFC 4757), PBKDF2 string-to-key, n-fold, HMAC-SHA1-96 checksums
  ([e23b851](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/e23b851))
- Kerberos ASN.1 messages: AS-REQ, TGS-REQ, AP-REQ, Authenticator, KDC-REP parsing — all hand-rolled DER
  ([97b57a5](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/97b57a5))

  ([97b57a5](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/97b57a5))
- `Session::setup_kerberos()` and `Session::setup_kerberos_from_ccache()` public API
  ([3a63337](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/3a63337),

- Support for AES-256, AES-128, and RC4-HMAC encryption types, with AES-256 preferred
  ([01ad252](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/01ad252))

### Fixed

- KDC-REP field tags: pvno is `[0]` not `[1]` per RFC 4120
  ([3a63337](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/3a63337))
- AES-CTS key derivation: Ki constant is 0x55 (encrypt/decrypt integrity), not 0x99 (standalone checksum)
  ([661a245](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/661a245))
- TGS-REQ AP-REQ Authenticator was missing body checksum over KDC-REQ-BODY (RFC 4120 section 7.2.2, key usage 6)
  ([661a245](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/661a245))

### Key implementation details

Hard-won lessons from testing against Windows AD (documented in `src/auth/CLAUDE.md`):

- MS Kerberos OID (`1.2.840.48018.1.2.2`) required as primary SPNEGO mechanism for Windows
- Key usage 11 (not 7) for AP-REQ Authenticator encryption in SPNEGO exchanges
- GSS-API wrapping of AP-REQ inside SPNEGO mechToken
- Raw ticket byte pass-through (re-encoding corrupts the encrypted ticket)
- Session key etype detection from TGS-REP (may differ from ticket encryption type)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-08

  ([4122d16](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/4122d16))
- CANCEL requests and session expiry detection with `Error::SessionExpired`
  ([4924a2a](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/4924a2a))
- Docker test infrastructure — 12 Samba containers covering guest, auth, signing, readonly, ancient (SMB1), flaky, slow,
  encryption (GCM + CCM), 50 shares, max read size, with 43 integration tests
  ([8edf837](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/8edf837),
  [7ee088f](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/7ee088f),
  [812ad39](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/812ad39))
- Docker tests in CI — builds containers and runs 43 tests on every PR
  ([488e1d0](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/488e1d0))
- 7 runnable examples: `list_shares`, `list_directory`, `read_file`, `streaming_download`, `disk_space`,
  `watch_directory`, `write_file` ([7203bdb](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/7203bdb))
- `Send + Sync` bounds on `Pack` trait for async callers
  ([4538205](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/4538205))
- GitHub Actions CI: fmt, clippy, test, doc, MSRV 1.85
  ([f0b00cd](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/f0b00cd))

### Fixed

- `STATUS_PENDING` handling — `receive_response()` now loops past interim responses instead of treating them as errors
  ([8edf837](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/8edf837))
- Multi-credit charges — streaming download/upload and `write_file_with_progress` were sending `credit_charge=1` for
  MB-sized payloads, Samba rejects with `STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER`
  ([8edf837](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/8edf837))
- Cipher fallback — fall back to AES-128-CCM when server omits encryption negotiate context
  ([812ad39](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/812ad39))

### Improved

- Smart read selection — sequential for files < MaxReadSize (1 RTT), pipelined only when beneficial
  ([3f0cd77](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/3f0cd77))
- Credit request bumped from 32 to 256 per request, credits grow rapidly
  ([dd36181](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/dd36181))
- Pipeline uses server-negotiated MaxReadSize/MaxWriteSize with correct multi-credit CreditCharge
  ([b0cacdd](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/b0cacdd))
- `trivial_message!` and `nt_status_codes!` macros to reduce boilerplate
  ([fb4b9e4](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/fb4b9e4))
- CLAUDE.md files for all 8 modules, agent docs colocated with code
  ([2d884d0](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/2d884d0))

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- Concurrent pipelined read and write — send multiple READ/WRITE requests by filling the credit window, reassemble
  responses in offset order, handles out-of-order responses
  ([7f3068a](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/7f3068a))
- Share enumeration — IPC$ + srvsvc RPC flow, QNAP returns 8 disk shares, Pi returns 1
  ([cbed0ab](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/cbed0ab))
- `SmbClient` high-level API — `connect()`, `list_shares()`, `connect_share()`, `reconnect()`, stored credentials
  ([cbed0ab](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/cbed0ab))
- Convenience `smb2::client::connect("host:445", "user", "pass")` one-liner
  ([cbed0ab](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/cbed0ab))
- File operations: `write_file`, `delete_file`, `stat`, `rename`, `create_directory`, `delete_directory`
  ([c80f126](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/c80f126))
- Clean re-exports from `lib.rs` — `use smb2::{SmbClient, Tree}` instead of reaching into submodules
  ([cdb203e](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/cdb203e))
- 4 runnable examples: `list_shares`, `list_directory`, `read_file`, `write_file`
  ([cdb203e](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/cdb203e))
- Benchmarks against native macOS SMB and `smb` crate:
  small files 2-3x faster, medium files match native on upload, 8.5x faster than `smb` on download
  ([031d52b](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/031d52b),
  [4cbc961](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/4cbc961))
- Integration tests against QNAP NAS (SMB 3.1.1, NTLM, AES-GMAC) and Raspberry Pi 4 (SMB 3.1.1, guest)
  ([c80f126](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/c80f126))

### Fixed

- Preauth hash: exclude final SESSION_SETUP success response from hash — including it produces wrong keys for SMB 3.1.1
  ([32f0f30](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/32f0f30))
- QueryDirectory: cap `OutputBufferLength` to 65536, always send `"*"` pattern (empty filename rejected by QNAP + Samba)
  ([b9d49f7](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/b9d49f7))
- GMAC uses AES-128-GCM (16-byte key), not AES-256-GCM
  ([dc91351](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/dc91351))
- GMAC nonce needs server role bit for response verification
  ([dc91351](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/dc91351))
- Only verify signature when `SMB2_FLAGS_SIGNED` is set (skip STATUS_PENDING and oplock breaks)
  ([dc91351](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/dc91351))

- SP800-108 key derivation for SMB 3.0/3.0.2 (legacy labels) and 3.1.1 (preauth hash context)
  ([a7080f3](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/a7080f3))
- LZ4 compression via `lz4_flex` (pure Rust, zero C deps)
  ([a7080f3](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/a7080f3))

  ([36428728](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/36428728))
- RPC module: DCE/RPC PDU encoding, NDR encoding for `NetShareEnumAll`
  ([36428728](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/36428728))
- Structured logging via `log` crate — info for lifecycle, debug for protocol, trace for bytes, never logs secrets
  ([1d7273a](https://github.com/vdavid/smb2/commit/1d7273a))
- Error types with `is_retryable()`, `status()`, `Auth`, `Timeout`, `Disconnected`, `SessionExpired` variants
